Our team's overarching goal was to streamline the survey result generation process for innovators who had taken the Health Equity Assessment Tool survey. My key responsibilities on the project included designing a visually appealing mockup of the report, developing a robust system capable of generating personalized reports, and leveraging SFTP to seamlessly upload the PDF reports to J&J Innovation's server. This project required close collaboration with key stakeholders, including technical and non-technical teams, to ensure a smooth and effective implementation of the solution.",
